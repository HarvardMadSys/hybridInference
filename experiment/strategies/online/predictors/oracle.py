"""Oracle predictor that uses ground-truth output length from trace replay.

This predictor "cheats" by reading the true response_tokens from the request
object. It serves as an upper bound on what any online predictor can achieve,
isolating the impact of prediction error on end-to-end routing cost.

Usage:
    This predictor is used in the oracle sensitivity experiment to answer:
    "If we had perfect output length prediction, how much would routing improve?"

    The gap between PD-Oracle and PD-EMA quantifies the cost of prediction error.
    The gap between PD-Oracle and Optimal quantifies the cost of online decisions.
