"""Helpers for extracting a stable client IP from proxied requests.

The single decision point for client identity. Everything downstream — request
logs, per-IP rate limits, the auth-failure blocklist, sticky routing affinity,
and the rows written to ``api_logs`` — reads its answer. See
``docs/developer/trusted-proxies-and-client-ips.md`` for the full trust model.

Security model
--------------

1. **The socket peer is the only initially trustworthy network fact.**
   Forwarding headers (``CF-Connecting-IP``, ``X-Forwarded-For``, etc.) are
   usable only when the immediate peer is in an explicitly configured
   trusted-proxy CIDR set.

2. **Explicit trust only.** Forwarding headers from untrusted peers are
   *never* used — they may be attacker-supplied. The trusted-proxy CIDR set
   defaults to empty, so forwarding headers are never trusted unless the
   operator explicitly opts in.

3. **First untrusted hop terminates provenance.** Within a trusted chain, walk
   right-to-left. Discard only hops explicitly in the trusted-proxy set. The
   first hop that is *not* a trusted proxy **is where provenance terminates**:
   * if it is routable, it is the real client;
   * if it is non-routable or malformed, provenance is **unresolved**.
   Never continue farther left — that would cross the trust boundary and
   consume attacker-controlled values.

4. **Separate Cloudflare trust.** A generic trusted reverse proxy does NOT
   make a client-supplied ``CF-Connecting-IP`` safe. ``CF-Connecting-IP`` is
   trusted only when the immediate peer is in an *additional* explicitly
   configured Cloudflare-authorized network. This network must be configured
   separately from generic trusted proxies.

5. **``"unknown"`` is a legitimate outcome.** If the socket peer is
   non-routable and there is no trustworthy forwarding provenance, the result
   is ``"unknown"`` rather than masquerading an internal address as a client.

6. **Unresolved identity is not recoverable.** When client provenance fails,
   there is no information to distinguish clients behind a shared proxy. The
   proxy IP is useful for diagnosing *where a connection came from*, but it is
   NOT a substitute for *who the client was*. Consumers must handle unresolved
   identity explicitly rather than silently falling back to the proxy address.

``trusted_proxies`` and ``trusted_cloudflare_networks`` are validated at
startup as comma-separated CIDR lists; invalid entries fail configuration.
