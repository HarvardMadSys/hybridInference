"""Weight assignment strategies for routing between local and remote adapters.

This module hosts ``FixedRatioStrategy`` (used by ``RoutingManager`` to assign
per-adapter weights based on routing.yaml's ``local_fraction``).  It is
unrelated to the per-model router strategy registry exposed by the package
``__init__`` (``register_strategy`` / ``build_router``); we re-export
``FixedRatioStrategy`` from the package root for backward compatibility with
``from routing.strategies import FixedRatioStrategy`` callers.
