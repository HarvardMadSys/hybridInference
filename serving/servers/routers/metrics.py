"""Expose Prometheus metrics at /metrics.

If prometheus_client is unavailable or METRICS_ENABLED=0, returns a minimal
payload so the endpoint still exists without crashing.

Note: This endpoint does NOT perform active database queries to avoid blocking
Prometheus scrapes. Database connection status is updated by:
- /health endpoint (active SELECT 1 queries)
- Bootstrap initialization (on startup)
- Auth middleware (on request authentication failures)
